# FUCCI Annotation App 

This repo contains the FUCCI Annotation App code.  This work presents a MATLAB-based software, termed FUCCI Annotation App, that allows for FUCCI cell image quantification by applying semi-automated segmentation and manual tracking.

### Data Example

To download our input data example go to [data example](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tSrMb21MdjDaIFe_EDRtNuOHccS1czub?usp=drive_link). Use the same format for your FUCCI image set to work with our App.

### Standalone Windows installer
You can download the installer file from GUI_versions/for_redistribution. It is a standalone Windows-based installer. You just need to download it and install it on your Windows system without the need to install MATLAB software.  It also can be installed and run on the virtual Windows machine on MAC systems.

### Source Matlab code

The source Matlab code is app_segmentation.mlapp and can open and be editted by MATAB software

### Usage
FUCCI Annotation App is a MATLAB-based application that's specifically designed for the analysis of FUCCI cell images captured in YFP and Texas Red channels. This application employs a hybrid automated and manual process for image segmentation and tracking. It initially separates different objects within the two channel images, and subsequently measures the intensity of the YFP and Texas Red signals.
